# LA County Neighborhood Analysis
Analysis of LA County neighborhood amenities/venues based on median income. We are particularly interested in whether neighborhoods with the lowest median income have access to parks, trails or other natural areas. We would also like to see what venues are present in these neighborhoods that are dedicated to healthy lifestyle and wellbeing (like gyms and spas), compared to their counterparts in the highest median income neighborhoods.

- Obtain neighborhoods located in LA County, along with their population, median income and latitude/longitude coordinates. 
- Clean up data
- Obtain list of 20 neighborhoods with lowest median income and 20 neighborhoods with highest median income
- Normalize data as needed and perform Machine Learning KMeans Clustering technique to cluster neighborhoods. 
- Use Foursquare API to obtain 100 venues in each neighborhood.
